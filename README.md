### Snapdragon-Powered Dell 7455: The Quest for Linux Boot

I've never worked with firmware or anything beyond being a long-time Linux user — going on 20 years now.

A few months ago, I got a Dell Latitude 7455 running Windows 11 with a Snapdragon X Elite (x1e80100). After digging around online and checking out a few interesting projects — like [Ubuntu Concept](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-24-10-concept-snapdragon-x-elite/48800), [Linaro Debian Installer](https://git.codelinaro.org/linaro/qcomlt/demos/debian-12-installer-image), [Alex Vinarskis - Tributo](https://github.com/alexVinarskis/linux-x1e80100-dell-tributo) or [Linux-on-Snapdragon by Jeremiah Hawley](https://github.com/Jeremiah-Hawley/Linux-on-Snapdragon) — I started jotting down notes and running some experiments.

This repo is where I’ll be collecting everything I find or figure out along the way. That is notes, thoughts, haks, resources and so on.


⚠️ _This is very much a work in progress — expect rough edges, half-baked ideas, and updates as I go._

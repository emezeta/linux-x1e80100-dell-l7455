### Snapdragon-Powered Dell 7455: The Quest for Linux Boot

I have no prior experience with firmware or low-level development ‚Äî my background is mostly long-term Linux use, almost 20 years, and some basic programming skills.
A few months ago, I got a Dell Latitude 7455 with a Snapdragon X Elite (x1e-80-100), running Windows 11. After digging around online and checking out some interesting projects like [Ubuntu Concept](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-24-10-concept-snapdragon-x-elite/48800), [Linaro Debian Installer](https://git.codelinaro.org/linaro/qcomlt/demos/debian-12-installer-image) and others, I started jotting down notes and running a few experiments.
I'll be collecting everything I find or discover here -notes, thoughts, hacks, resources, etc. I'm doing this mostly to learn something cool as I go!

‚ö†Ô∏è _This is very much a work in progress. It's not meant to deliver or release anything ‚Äî expect rough edges, half-baked ideas, and updates as I go along._
